**Siemens Xcelerator** will fully incorporate **MindSphere** – our leading **industrial IoT** solution – into a wide range of industry solutions and modular cloud services.

As a result, the industrial IoT capabilities of MindSphere will be available to the full Siemens portfolio, software and hardware alike, while at the same time enabling our customer and partners across the Siemens Xcelerator ecosystem to build their industry specific applications.

All the combined IoT capabilities are called **Industrial Operations X**  – our vision for the fusion of IT and OT. A modular portfolio including our IoT and edge solutions and our low code as well as manufacturing capabilities and [much more](https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/industrial-operations-x-brings-cutting-edge-it-and-ai-industrial-automation).
